						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p>
						Over the course of doing process improvement work for several years, it became emergently clear how powerful the right technology could be in reducing end-to-end costs and freeing people to focus on higher value opportunities.  My curiosity and interest in gaining new skills led me to self-study front-end languages in my own time.
						<br><br>
						From there I applied and was aceepted into The Coding Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill where I had a phenomenally intense, immersive experience building full-stack applications.
