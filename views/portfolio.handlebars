Cryptogifs is a search application that get's the first 10 results for your search term via Giphy's API, dispalays the static image by default, and onClick toggles between the static image or animated gif.  Currently, search terms added by users are not persistent - there is not a database for storing new items; the initial terms are hardcoded within a JavaScript file and user entries are stored on the client within a JavaScript array." data-title="Cryptogifs">

After presenting the show's host with a limited prototype of a webapp version of the soundboard, I was given access to the full catalog of soundclips to create the offical soundboard for the podcast.  Each sound tile is created as an iteration of a for loop over an array of objects with key/value pairs for the sound's title, image url, and mp3 url.  In the near future I'd like to try my hand at native app design to turn this into a downloadable mobile app." data-title="Soundboard">

Utilized Semantic-UI for modals, page-section division and anchoring within a single page; Google's Geocoder, InfoWindow, and Custom Search APIs getting location data, displaying map icons, and curating material for the 'corkboard' section; Mentors and Mentees are stored in Firebase and assigned a specific icon based on the value for their 'affiliation' field in the database." data-title="The Mentor">

For scraping I am using Cheerio.js and storing results in MongoDB. Once I had the news agregation functionality working seamlesly I branched out into adding a note/commenting feature per article (associated Note model via Mongoose). From there I started rolling out user profile, login, article storage, and private messaging -- however, these features are still in development.  I am working on incorporating those features into Protected Dusk as well as transitioning to Vue.js for a frontend framework." data-title="Protected Dusk">

PetFriender invites a user to submit information about themself and their pet to match them with another user and their pet for super fun group activities.  I feel Materialize's signature clean design framework appeals to PetFriender's target audience; for future development I plan on incorporating Multer and/or Cloudinary with Stormpath or Passport and MongoDB to provide more robust, persistent user profiles. It's a really fun idea for a service for people like me who are owned by their dogs!" data-title="PetFriender">
